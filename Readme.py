    ## Project Description
    Our project is a Music Streaming App that allows users to upload, stream, search, and manage audio files. The app consists of three main components:
    - Two front-end websites, one for end users + one for database managers
    - Google Cloud Storage to store audio files
    - A middleware API to route requests from the front end and database administrator sites through a hash function
    - MongoDB database to store audio file information, running on EC2

    ## Middleware
    ### `main.py`
    The `main.py` file is the main server script for the Music Streaming App. It implements a Flask-based API that handles various endpoints for managing audio files and user authentication. The API communicates with a MongoDB database to store and retrieve audio file metadata and user information.

    **Database Connection**
    - The script establishes a connection to a MongoDB database using the provided connection URL.
    - It uses the pymongo library to interact with the database.


    **Hash Function**
    - The hash_function() is a utility function that generates a hash value based on the artist name and track name. It has the following steps...
        - Extract Initials from Names
            - Artist Initials: The function first looks at the artist's name, takes the first letter of the first word and the first letter of the last word to form the artist initials. 
                - For example, from "Taylor Swift", it takes 'T' from "Taylor" and 'S' from "Swift" to make "TS".
            - Track Initials: Similarly, it takes the track's name and extracts the first letter of the first word and the first letter of the last word to form the track initials.
                - For example, from "Love Story", it takes 'L' from "Love" and 'S' from "Story" to make "LS".
        - Convert Initials to Numbers
            - The function then converts these letters (initials) into their ASCII numerical values.
            - Sum the ASCII Values
            - The ASCII values of both the artist initials and the track initials are summed up to get a total number.
        - Decide the Storage Option
            - Even/Odd Check: If this total number is even, the data will be stored in JSON file 0. If it's odd, the data will be stored in JSON file 1.
            - Error Check: If somehow both the artist's and the track's names are missing, leading to a total sum of 0, the function will print an error message indicating the absence of names.



    **JSON Serialization**
    - The `jsonify_mongo()` function is a helper function that converts MongoDB document objects to JSON-serializable format.
    - It takes a list of dictionaries representing MongoDB documents and converts any ObjectId fields to string format.
    - This function is used to prepare the response data for API endpoints that return MongoDB documents.


    **API Endpoints**

    `/api/audio/upload (POST)`
    - Handles the upload of a new audio file.
    - Expects a JSON payload containing the artist name, track name, and file URL.
    - Generates a hash value using the hash_function() based on the artist name and track name.
    - Inserts the audio file metadata into the corresponding MongoDB collection based on the hash value.
    - Returns a JSON response indicating the success status and the uploaded audio file metadata.


    `/api/audio/list (GET)`
    - Retrieves a list of audio files from the database.
    - Supports pagination using the page and limit query parameters.
    - Allows sorting the results based on the sort_by query parameter (default: "created_at") and the order query parameter (default: descending).
    - Fetches the audio file metadata from the MongoDB database based on the specified pagination and sorting parameters.
    - Returns a JSON response containing the list of audio file metadata.


    `/api/audio/search (GET)`
    - Performs a search for audio files based on the provided artist name and/or track name.
    - Expects the artistName and/or trackName query parameters.
    - Searches the MongoDB database for audio file metadata matching the provided search criteria.
    - Supports pagination using the page and limit query parameters.
    - Returns a JSON response containing the matching audio file metadata.


    `/api/audio/edit/<id> (PUT)`
    - Updates the metadata of an existing audio file.
    - Expects the audio file ID as a URL parameter.
    - Accepts a JSON payload containing the updated artist name, track name, and/or file URL.
    - Updates the corresponding audio file metadata in the MongoDB database.
    - Returns a JSON response indicating the success status and a message.

    `/api/audio/delete/<id> (DELETE)`
    - Deletes an audio file from the database.
    - Expects the audio file ID as a URL parameter.
    - Removes the corresponding audio file metadata from the MongoDB database.
    - Returns a JSON response indicating the success status and a message.


    `/api/register (POST)`
    - Handles user registration.
    - Expects a JSON payload containing the username and password.
    - Checks if the username already exists in the database.
    - If the username is available, hashes the password using bcrypt and stores the user information in the MongoDB database.
    - Returns a JSON response indicating the success status and a message.


    `/api/login (POST)`
    - Handles user login.
    - Expects a JSON payload containing the username and password.
    - Retrieves the user information from the MongoDB database based on the provided username.
    - Compares the provided password with the stored hashed password using bcrypt.
    - If the credentials are valid, returns a JSON response indicating the success status and a message.
    - If the credentials are invalid, returns a JSON response indicating the failure status and an error message.

    **Error Handling**
    - Each API endpoint includes error handling using try-except blocks.
    - If an exception occurs during the execution of an endpoint, an appropriate error response is returned indicating the failure status and an error message.


    **Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)**
    - The API includes Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) support using the flask_cors library.
    - CORS allows the API to be accessed from different origins (domains) in a web browser.


    **Server Configuration**
    - The Flask server is configured to run in debug mode (`debug=True`) for development purposes.
    - It is set to listen on all available network interfaces (`host='0.0.0.0'`).
    - The server port is determined by the environment variable `PORT` if available, otherwise it defaults to port `5000`.

    ## Client Application
    ### `1_ðŸ’¿_Music_Streaming_App.py`
    This Streamlit page represents the main user interface for the Music Streaming App. It allows users to stream, search, and upload audio files.

    **Authentication**
    - The page includes authentication checks using the `login_page()` and `register_page()` functions from `api_calls.py`.
    - If the user is not logged in, they are redirected to the login page, where they can enter their username and password to authenticate.
    - If the user doesn't have an account, they can navigate to the registration page to create a new account by providing a username and password.
    - Once authenticated, the user is redirected back to the main Music Streaming App page, where they can access the "Stream", "Search", and "Upload" tabs.
    - The authentication status is stored in the Streamlit session state (st.session_state.logged_in) to persist across page reloads.
    - If the user clicks the "Logout" button, their authentication status is cleared, and they are redirected back to the login page.

    **Stream**
    - Users can browse and stream audio files.
    - The files are sorted based on the selected option (Recently Uploaded, Artist Name, or Track Name).
    - The audio files are fetched from the API using the `fetch_audio_files()` function from `api_calls.py`.
    - The retrieved audio files are displayed in a user-friendly format, showing the artist name, track name, and an audio player for each file.
    - Users can click on the audio player to play, pause, or seek within the audio file.

    **Search**
    - Users can search for audio files by entering the artist name and/or track name.
    - The search results are fetched from the API using the `search_audio_files()` function from `api_calls.py`.

    **Upload**
    - Users can upload a new audio file by providing the artist name, track name, and selecting the audio file.
    - The file is uploaded to Google Cloud Storage using the `upload_file_to_gcs()` function from `api_calls.py` and the metadata is sent to the API using the `send_to_api()` function.  

    ### `2_ðŸ’¾_Music_Streaming_DB_Management.py`

    This Streamlit page serves as a database management interface for administrators. It allows administrators to view, upload, edit, and delete audio file entries in the database.

    **Authentication**
    - The page includes authentication checks using the `login_page()` and `register_page()` functions from `api_calls.py`.
    - If the user is not logged in, they are redirected to the login page, where they can enter their username and password to authenticate.
    - If the user doesn't have an account, they can navigate to the registration page to create a new account by providing a username and password.
    - Once authenticated, the user is redirected back to the main Music Streaming App page, where they can access the "Stream", "Search", and "Upload" tabs.
    - The authentication status is stored in the Streamlit session state (st.session_state.logged_in) to persist across page reloads.
    - If the user clicks the "Logout" button, their authentication status is cleared, and they are redirected back to the login page.
    
    **View**
    - Administrators can view the list of audio files in the database.
    - They can specify the page number and the number of entries per page.
    - The audio files are fetched from the API using the `fetch_audio_files()` function from api_calls.py.
    - The retrieved data is displayed in a table format, and administrators can download the data as a CSV file.
    
    **Upload**
    - Administrators can upload new audio files individually or in bulk using a CSV file.
    - For individual uploads, they provide the artist name, track name, and select the audio file.
    - The file is uploaded to Google Cloud Storage using the `upload_file_to_gcs()` function, and the metadata is sent to the API using the `send_to_api()` function.
    - For bulk uploads, administrators can upload a CSV file containing the artist name, tracke name, and file URL, and each entry is processed and uploaded to the API.
    
    **Edit**
    - Administrators can edit existing audio file entries.
    - They can provide the track ID and update the artist name, track name, and/or file URL.
    - The updates are sent to the API using the `update_audio_file()` function from `api_calls.py`.
    - Administrators can also perform bulk edits by uploading a CSV file containing the track IDs and the updated information.
    
    **Delete**
    - Administrators can delete audio file entries by providing the track ID.
    - The deletion is performed by sending a request to the API using the `delete_audio_file()` function from `api_calls.py`.
    - Administrators can also perform bulk deletions by uploading a CSV file containing the track IDs to be deleted.
    
    ### `api_calls.py`
    This module contains helper functions for interacting with the API, including functions for user authentication (login and registration) and various operations related to audio files (upload, fetch, search, update, delete).
    - `create_uuid()` Generates a random UUID and returns it as a 32-character string without hyphens.
    - `upload_file_to_gcs(file)` Uploads a file to Google Cloud Storage (GCS) using the provided service account credentials. It generates a unique filename using create_uuid() and returns the public URL of the uploaded file.
    - `send_to_api(track_info)` Sends a POST request to the API endpoint /api/audio/upload with the provided track information (artist name, track name, and file URL) as a JSON payload. It returns the parsed JSON response from the API.
    - `fetch_audio_files(page=1, sort_by='created_at', order='desc', limit=10)` Fetches audio files from the API endpoint /api/audio/list with optional pagination and sorting parameters. It returns the parsed JSON response from the API.
    - `search_audio_files(artist_name='', track_name='')` Searches for audio files based on the provided artist name and/or track name by sending a GET request to the API endpoint /api/audio/search. It returns the parsed JSON response from the API.
    - `update_audio_file(audio_id, artist_name=None, track_name=None, file_url=None)` Updates an audio file with the specified audio_id by sending a PUT request to the API endpoint /api/audio/edit/{audio_id} with the provided update fields (artist name, track name, and/or file URL) as a JSON payload. It returns the parsed JSON response from the API.
    - `delete_audio_file(id)` Deletes an audio file with the specified id by sending a DELETE request to the API endpoint /api/audio/delete/{id}. It returns the parsed JSON response from the API.
    - `login(username, password)` Sends a POST request to the API endpoint /login with the provided username and password as a JSON payload. It returns True if the login is successful (status code 200), otherwise it returns False.
    - `register(username, password)` Sends a POST request to the API endpoint /register with the provided username and password as a JSON payload. It returns True if the registration is successful (status code 201), otherwise it returns False.
    
    ## Future Improvements
    
    **Better GCS File Management**
    - Add functionality to delete files from GCS when an audio file is deleted from the database based on the file URL.
    - Implement a mechanism to handle file versioning or updates in GCS.
    - Use environment variables for GCS bucket name and service account file path.
    - Add error handling for GCS file upload failures.
    - Implement file size restrictions and validation for uploaded files.

    **User Roles and Permissions**
    - Implement role-based access control (RBAC) to differentiate between regular users and administrators.
    - Define different permissions for each role, such as viewing, uploading, editing, and deleting audio files.
    - Add an admin panel to manage user roles and permissions.
    - Secure API endpoints based on user roles and permissions.
    - Implement user authentication using JWT tokens for better security.
